# Anonify

Anonify is a chat app that enables its users to chat anonymously with people around them about
topics they are interested. Also, users will be able to see people around them and chat with them
non-anonymously. It instantly connects you with new people around. Once users create their
own nickname, then they are all ready to chat. It's just that fast and easy!

We wanted to chat with people in the campus anonymously about topics we are interested. This
is our main motivation. It’s main functionally isn’t just chatting but also providing location
based anonymous chat rooms.

Similar Products: Our project and MeetMe have some common features like listing and chatting
people around you. We will have chat rooms, chat topics and anonymous chats that MeetMe
doesn’t have.

Features of the application:

- Sign up if you don’t have an account
- Login if you have an account
- Choose the range
- List people around you and send message to them
- Create new anonymous chat topics if you wish
- Send messages to anonymous chat rooms that you are interested
- Chat with people you have sent message previously
